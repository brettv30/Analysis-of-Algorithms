# Analysis-of-Algorithms

This repository is filled with all files pertaining to my CSC-260: Analysis of Algorithms course. In this course we heavily focused on using R to run analysis on various sized data sets. We discussed and implemented concepts like Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistics Regression, Backwards Stepwise Regression, K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. 

A large portion of the course was focused on creating reports based on our findings, almost every homework assignment had us creating a report in some fashion. I found this extremely beneficial to my learning of how to interpret and display the data in a meaningful manner. 

There are some chapter walkthroughs in this repository as well. The book pertaining to these walkthroughs is *Introduction to R for Business Intelligence* by *Jay Gendron*. This was an extremely useful resource for someone who had no experience with R before and I highly recommend using this as a learning source. Some of the links in the book are a little outdated, but besides that it was a great resource to use along with the class.
